## Description
* The goal of this first assignment is implementing any kind of image filtering method using Python, Matlab, or both of them.
* In this assignment, I choose to apply several kinds of noise in the image, implement mean and median filtering to denoise it, and then compare them to decide which one is better.

## Tools
* Tesseract
* Python 3.7
* Some Python libraries:
  * Open-CV
  * PyTesseract

### Installation
1. Using Homebrew to install Tesseract in Mac
    ```bash
    $ brew install tesseract

    # This formula contains only the "eng", "osd", and "snum" language data files.
    # If you need any other supported languages, run `brew install tesseract-lang`.

    # To install other languages
    $ brew install tesseract-lang
    ```
    Installation of Tesseract in other OS will be different.

## Implementation
### Tesseract
Tesseract is an open-source OCR engine. It began as a Ph.D. research project in HP Labs Bristol, then developed by **HP** between 1984 and 1994. In 2005, HP released Tesseract as an open-source software. Since 2006 it is developed by **Google**.
